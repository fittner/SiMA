/**
   A wrapper for other Portrayal2Ds which also draws a big circle around them -- useful for
   distinguishing one object from other similar-looking objects.  When you create this
   CirclePortrayal2D, you will pass in an underlying Portrayal2D which is supposed to draw
   the actual object; CirclePortrayal2D will then add on the circle.  If the object
   will draw itself (it's its own Portrayal2D), you can signify this by passing in null for the
   underlying Portrayal2D.
   
   <p>There are certain guidelines you can specify for when the circle is to be drawn.  At construction
   time you can state that the circle should <i>only</i> be drawn when the object is selected.
   Additionally if you call the setCircleShowing(...) function, you can turn off or on circle
   drawing entirely for this CirclePortrayal2D.
   
   <p>You may specify a color or paint for the circle (the default is blue).
   
   <p>The circle is drawn centered at the object's [info.draw.x, info.draw.y]
   origin and with the radius:

   <pre><tt>
   radius:     (int)(or * max(info.draw.width,info.draw.height)) + dr;
   </tt></pre>

   <p>... that is, or is a value which scales when you zoom in, and dr adds 
   additional fixed pixels.  The default is or = 1.0, dr = 0.  This draws the circle 
   at twice the expected width and height of the object.

   <p><b>Note:  </b> One oddity of CircledPortrayal2D is due to the fact that the circle is only
   drawn if the object is being drawn.  While most FieldPortrayals ask objects just off-screen
   to draw themselves just to be careful, if an object is significantly off-screen, it may not
   be asked to draw itself, and so the circle will not be drawn -- even though part of the circle 
   could be on-screen at the time!  C'est la vie.
