The interfaces that transmit data between the modules are divided into two sets: sending and receiving interfaces. <a href="../../../../../model_v38_figure_a.png" target="_blank"><img src="../../../../../model_v38_figure_a.png" align=right width=200px></a> 
Although the sending interface is never used by another module - in opposition to the receiving interface - it has to be added by the modules by convention. 
For displaying and debugging purposes the structure of the functional model including the interfaces is extracted by introspection from the source code. 
Interfaces that start with I connect modules; the ones that start with D connect modules with internal storages (not to be confused with the 
knowledgebase/memory).
