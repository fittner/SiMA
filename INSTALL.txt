2. Directory Structure (first four levels)
------------------------------------------
	\ ARS
		\ PA
			\ BWv1
				\ BW 					(1) ... Bubble World / ARSIN-World. the world and the agents within the world
				\ DecisionUnitInterface (1)  ... interfaces which are needed to decouple control systems stored in DecisionUnits from code in BW
				\ DecisionUnits 		(1) ... control systems / decision units 
				\ ExtTools 				(2) ... tools needed for the whole system like world setup editor
				\ jgraphx 				(3) ... visualization tools like pie charts, block diagrams, etc.
				\ Mason 				(3')... Multi Agent Simulation of Networks or Neighbors or ...
				\ MasonPhysics2D 		(3) ... Physics engine addon for MASON
				\ protegeAPI 			(3) ... the ontolgies for some decision units are written in OWL. this api provides tools to work with them
				\ Sim 					(1) ... The control loop of the simulation plus the configuration
				\ TestApps 				(2) ... additional testbeds/simulations

	(1) core directories. here most of coding for this project is done.
	(2)	adittionals directories. a place where testing and debugging can be done. also some kind of forking place.
	(3) third party projects. 
	(3') some bugfixing which was not included in the official branch.

3. Installation
---------------
	1. extract the ARSIN_v??.zip to a directory. e.g. SVN
	2. link the directory to your file system
		a. LINUX: /home/$user/SVN/ARS/.... 
		b. S:\ARS\...
	3. start ECLIPSE and select "S:\ARS\PA\BWv1" or "/SVN/ARS/PA/BWv1" as workspace directory
	
	If you want to use another directory, please adapt "ARS/PA/BWv1/DecisionUnitInterface/statictools/clsGetARSPath.java" to meet you requirements.

4. Run the Simulation
---------------------
	The common starting point is "ARS/PA/BWv1/Sim/src/sim/clsBWMainWithUI.java". 
	
	Possible arguments are:
		-config <arg>
			<arg> int 0-3
					0: filename = "testsetup.main.properties"
					1: filename = "funguseater.main.properties"
					2: filename = "hare_vs_lynx.main.properties"
					3: filename = "one_bubble.properties"
			<arg> "filename"
					filename = "filename"
			<default>
					0
					
		-adapter <arg>
			<arg> Boolean	
					true: show fast config adapter (allows a quick setup change of the config file defined in -config)
					false: skip fast config adapter
			<default>
					false
					
		-path <arg>
			<arg> "directory"
					selects a different config file directory. 
			<default>
				"ARS/PA/BWv1/Sim/config"
				
		-impstages <arg>
			<arg> "filename"
					defines for decision unit PA (psycho analysis) which implmented versions of each module should be used.
			<default>
					as defined in the code
