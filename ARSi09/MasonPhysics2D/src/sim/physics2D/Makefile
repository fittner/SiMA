#### Physics2D Makefile
#### By Sean Luke

#### Relevant Stuff:
#### To see all your make options:  type   make help
#### To switch from jikes to javac:  change the JAVAC variable below
#### To add flags (like -O) to javac:  change the FLAGS variable below


### If you don't have jikes set up, change to JAVAC = javac
#JAVAC = javac 
JAVAC = jikes ${JIKESFLAGS}

# The default flags for javac and jikes
FLAGS = -g

# Additional flags for jikes
JIKESFLAGS = -nowarn -target 1.3


# Main java files, not including the 3D stuff
