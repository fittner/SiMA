<center><h1>ARSIN World v1</h1></center>

<p>The ARSIN World simulator is an artificial life simulation platform. It was created to serve as a test platform for the psychoanalytically inspired control architecture developed by project <a href="http://ars.ict.tuwien.ac.at">ARS</a>. A temporal firewall decouples the control architecture implementations from the simulation engine (Sim) and the world definition (BW).</p>

<td>Welcome to MASON, a simulator designed for simple-multiagent simulations, or to be used as a core library inside more sophisticated multiagent simulators. <br/>
MASON was written by Sean Luke, Gabriel Catalin Balan, and Liviu Panait. Additional code and apps were written by Daniel Kuebrich and Sean Paus. Much help was provided by Claudio Cioffi-Revilla and Ken De Jong.  MASON is a joint effort of George Mason University's Evolutionary Computation Laboratory (in the Computer Science Department), and GMU's Center for Social Complexity.<br/>
<i>Currently, MASON v13 is used for ARSIN World Simulator.</i>

<td width="20%"><b>Physics</b></td>
<td>The package is intended to implement a 2D rigid body physics simulation system in MASON and pure, 100% Java.  The goal is to be both fast and highly portable.  We may at some point examine also doing a 3D physics simulation environment using odejava (see http://odejava.org/).  In the meantime, if you want a 3D physics simulation system, we recommend examing Breve (http://www.spiderland.org/breve/), which isn't in Java but is pretty impressive (and with a highly responsive developer). <br/>

The physic simulator uses MASON's Continuous2D class for storage of objects for drawing purposes but uses its own data structures for computing neighborhood information, interactions, etc.  The system provides for a variety of constraints, collision response, some basic floor friction, arbitrary forces, etc.  The package will only run with MASON 9 or above because it uses the double-valued Heap class.</td>

<p><a href="sim_uml.png"><img align="left" border=0 style="margin-right:10px" src="sim_uml.png" width="250px"></a> The whole project is divided into seven sub-projects (Details in the figure are omitted not to occlude the diagram. The sub-project at the origin of an arrow accesses classes which are contained by the sub-project the arrow points at.). The reason for this design decision is to keep the various sub-projects as independent from each other as possible. The control architectures which are part of sub-project <b>DecisionUnit</b> are totally independent from the multi-agent framework in sub-project <b>MASON</b>. The main sub-project is <b>Simulator</b>. It is responsible for world creation and contains the scheduler described above. Each entity is created with its optional decision unit. How an entity is defined in detail is implemented in sub-project <b>World</b>. It contains things like the sensors, the bodies, interaction possibilities, and utilizes the two interfaces to the physics engine provided by <b>Physics</b>. In sub-project <b>DUInterface</b>, common classes needed for the decision unit framework are implemented. <b>MASON</b> provides several inspectors to view internal states of the agents. Body and entity related inspectors are stored in <b>World</b>. The ones necessary to view internal states of a decision unit are stored in <b>DUInspectors</b>. With this design, all three main parts of the simulation - the multi-agent simulation framework, the ARSIN world, and the decision units - can be exchanged without the need of changing much in the other sub-projects.</p>
