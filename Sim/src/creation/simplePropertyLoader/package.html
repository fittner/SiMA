This package contains the simple property loader. It is a straight forward approach that provides all means to store and load 
even more complex setups. Several different entity groups (even with one type occuring more than once) can be defined. Each
group defines what type of entites, the type of decision unit (if applicable), the number of entities to be created, the positioning
method (predefined, random) and values that override body or decisionunit defaults. Each entity is created using its default
configuration. The default values are optionally overwritten.
