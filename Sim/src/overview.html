   <p>The part that controls the whole ARSIN World simulation is the project <b>Simulator</b>. It is responsible for world creation and contains 
   the scheduler described above. Each entity is created with its optional decision unit. The two most important classes are <b>clsBWMainWithUI</b> and <b>clsBWScenarioSelectorUI</b>. 
   The first one starts the simulation with the provided runtime parameters; the second one provides a GUI instead of the runtime params. With <b>clsMainGetDefaultConfig</b> the set of 
   property files containing the default configs from the various classes is regenerated. The world is loaded and generated with the classes in the package sim.creation.*.</p>
