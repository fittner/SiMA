The world creation logic is provided by this package. Thus, a given property file is parsed and processed with the result of a 
world populated with different types of entities. eLoader contains the different values to select the appropriate loader for the
given file. clsLoader is the abstract class which has to be implemented by the various different loaders. Currently,
 only one implementation of a loader exists: creation.simplePropertyLoader.
