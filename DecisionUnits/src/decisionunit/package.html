The base class for all decision units and the factory to create any type of decision unit are part of this package. The base class implements the interface du.itf.itfDecisionUnit from the project DecisionUnitInterface. The factory implements the interface du.itf.itfDecisionUnitFactory from the same project. Thus it is possible to create any decision unit without incorporating the project DecisionUnits.
