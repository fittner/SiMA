The implementations of the 33 functional modules of the psychoanalytically inspired decision unit developed by project ARS are put into this package. The functional model is sketched in this figure: <a href="../../../model_v38_figure_a.png" target="_blank">model_v38_figure_a.png</a> and the description of
the different functions can be found here: <a href="../../../model_v38_desc_v59.pdf" target="_blank">model_v38_desc_v59.pdf</a>. clsModuleBase and clsModuleBaseKB are abstract base classes used for the functional modules. clsPsychicApparatus is container that stores the instances of the modules. The execution of each module is done elsewhere (pa._v38.clsProcessor).
